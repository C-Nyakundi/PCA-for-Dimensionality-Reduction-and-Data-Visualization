# PCA for Dimensionality-Reduction and Data Visualization
 
## Introduction
This repository contains Python code implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. PCA is a popular technique used in machine learning and data analysis to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving its important characteristics. The primary goal of PCA is to identify the directions (principal components) that maximize the variance in the data.

## PCA Process
PCA involves the following steps:
1. **Standardize the Data**: Ensure that the data has zero mean and unit variance.
2. **Compute the Covariance Matrix**: Calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized data.
3. **Find Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors**: Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.
4. **Sort Eigenvectors**: Sort the eigenvectors in decreasing order of their corresponding eigenvalues.

## Code Overview
The repository contains Python code implementing PCA using NumPy and scikit-learn. Here's an overview of the main components:

1. **PCA Class**: The `PCA` class defined in the `pca.py` file implements the PCA algorithm. It includes methods for fitting the PCA model to the data (`fit`) and transforming the data into the principal component space (`transform`).

2. **Example Usage**: The `main.py` file demonstrates how to use the `PCA` class with the wine dataset from scikit-learn. It loads the dataset, applies PCA, and visualizes the results using scatter plots.

3. **Visualization**: The code includes visualization of the original data and the data transformed into the principal component space. Scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between different classes in the dataset.

## Usage
To use the PCA implementation:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies (NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib).
3. Run the `main.py` file to see an example of PCA applied to the wine dataset and visualized using scatter plots.
